	<p><font face="Calibri">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the release of the iPhone 4S, many users have been getting frustrations of one of the most important factors. This is worse than the iPhone 4’s “Death-Grip”! Within hours of tinkering with their new phone, many noticed that it has a serious battery problem. Many claim that their new iPhone has very poor battery life; some even have problems such as 15% decrease in under an hour! 
							The writer of this article had the same problem too. His iPhone 4 would always have 25% left at the end of the day. But with his iPhone4S, he couldn’t get through his workday without it running out. He had to take his iPhone charger to work for the first time.
							Apple’s customer support thread is booming with complaints on this. It had 2,600 replies and been seen over 170,000 times. Apple had randomly called 4S users and asked them to place a file which would monitor the phone’s performance versus battery status to help diagnose their problem. 
							The writer hopes that there is a software issue because the battery packs for the iPhone 4 and the 4S is different. The iPhone 4S battery has a higher watt-hours capacity (according to a teardown performed by iFixit). But the faster processor and the main notification system might be the cause of bring the quality of its life down.
							Some have fixed this problem by turning of its time zone check feature.  It certainly has extended the battery life, but it’s still significantly lower than the iPhone 4.
							Either with a replacement or an update, many want this problem to be taken care of.
